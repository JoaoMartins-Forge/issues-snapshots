## Description

This sample demonstrates a way to generate multiple screenshots with Viewer from predefined camera orientations.
I takes adbantage of Viewer's [getScreenShot](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/GuiViewer3D/#getscreenshot-w-h-cb-overlayrenderer) method and [CAMERA_TRANSITION_COMPLETED](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/#camera-transition-completed) event.
To take advantage of it, you can use any JSON file with the format just like the `sampleViews.json` file.
In there, we have multiple arrays that can be used to configure the camera object.
From any specific configuration, you can use [getCameraFromViewArray](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/GuiViewer3D/#getcamerafromviewarray-params-model) method to check the corresponding array.
